BEWD: FINAL PROJECT
-------------------

#PROJECT NAME
I Do! Playlist Maker
by: Prima Prasertrat


#SUMMARY
Because wedding planning is expensive, couples use iPods as a substitute for DJs. Relying on personal music collections, this cost-cutting move often results in empty dance floors. Wedding Music Maker removes guesswork by inviting guests to crowdsource songs.  


#TARGET AUDIENCE
Guests invited to the wedding, including those who can and cannot attend. Estimated number of users is 40.
Male and females between the ages of 24-50 comprise the bulk of wedding guests. More than half use mobile devices for online communication.


#FUNCTIONALITY
Guests are invited to create two playlists: "I Do" and "I Do NOT". Users can search for songs to add to each playlist. They may also vote on songs from existing playlists.

The home page of Wedding Music Maker aggregates and displays the 10 most loved and hated songs side by side. Administrators can view all results to shape their wedding playlist.


#THIRD PARTY API
